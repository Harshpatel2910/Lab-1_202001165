### **Features :**
- artificial intelligence is used to recognise sound events.
- Alerts in real time for significant sound events, such as automobile horns and newborns.
- sound events are logged for the user.
- to guarantee low-latency real-time performance that is optimised for Android.

### **Non-Functional Conditions:**
- **Performance**: For real-time use, the programme should have quick reaction and processing speeds.
- **Usability**: People with hearing loss should be able to use the app without difficulty.
- **Accessibility**: The app should adhere to accessibility guidelines and be usable by persons with impairments.
- **Security**: To safeguard user privacy and the preservation of sound event, the app should have robust security mechanisms in place.
